## What Is ChestLink?
**Turn any chest you place into a portable virtual inventory accessible from any world.**

ChestLink allows players to bind a **real-placed chest** to a **virtual inventory** that can be opened from anywhere on the server — any world, any dimension, any map. It works like a portable storage system, but instead of using backpacks, players can link their storage to a physical chest they have created. This creates an immersive and intuitive storage system perfect for Survival, SMP, RPG, and Multi-World servers.

### 📥 Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/SergeantFuzzy/ChestLink/) or [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chestlink.130427/).
2. Place the `ChestLink-{version}.jar` file into your server’s `/plugins/` directory.
3. Start or restart your Paper/Spigot/Bukkit Minecraft server.
4. Customize settings in `plugins/ChestLink/config.yml` (optional).

Supports **Minecraft 1.20+** (Paper recommended).

---

### How It Works

1. Player holds a chest block.
2. Runs `/chestlink bind <name>`.
3. Places the chest and punches it.
4. A virtual inventory is created and linked.
5. Player can now open it anywhere using `/chestlink open`

If the original bound chest is **broken**, the inventory is **immediately deleted and wiped**.
